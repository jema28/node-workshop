# Node.js CMS workshop

Build your own Node.js project: your very own platform to write blog posts and save them. This is often referred to as a **content management system** (CMS).

1. Fork this repo and clone onto your machine.

The project has been split into steps, which are documented in separate files here on the master branch.  

Each step builds progressively on top of the previous step. Follow the instructions and commit the changes as prompted at the end of each step. Have fun!

### Keywords and jargon

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn **much** more if you get into the habit of typing things out.

Throughout each step, we have **bolded** any jargon that you may or may not be familiar with.  At the bottom, you'll find a *keywords* section, some of them with links to further explanations.  

There is also a link to the general Node Girls cheatsheet under Useful links at the end of this README.
